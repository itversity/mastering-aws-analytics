    "Let us get into the details related to AWS s3 Buckets, Folders, and Objects.\n",
    "* Create an AWS s3 bucket using AWS Web Console by using your initials and then retail. In my case, it is **dg-retail**. We cannot use underscores and other special characters than hyphen while creating buckets.\n",
    "* AWS S3 Bucket name has to be unique globally and it is owned by the account that created it.\n",
    "* Upload all the 6 folders from the retail_db data set which you might have set up earlier. Using AWS Web Console, you can upload only one file at a time.\n",
    "* S3 uses object storage (not typical file storage). Object Storage is abstraction to store files in s3."
